In **Ray Dalio‚Äôs** book *The Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail*, he examines the historical cycles of empire and economy, and compares the **U.S.** and **China** in that context. Here's how Dalio sees the future trajectory of the **U.S. vs. China**:

---

### üá∫üá∏ **United States: Declining Power, But Still Strong**

* **Dalio sees the U.S. in the later stages of its empire cycle**, with signs of decline such as:

  * **High debt levels** and ongoing **monetary inflation**.
  * Rising **internal conflict** (political polarization, wealth gaps).
  * **Declining education standards** and **productivity growth**.
  * Erosion of **global influence**, especially as the dollar‚Äôs dominance faces new threats.

* **However**, the U.S. retains many advantages:

  * Strong **innovation**, **military**, **universities**, and **rule of law**.
  * Leading **financial markets** and global reserve currency (for now).
  * A culture that still rewards **entrepreneurship and individualism**.

* **Outlook:** The U.S. may remain powerful but is **at risk of relative decline** unless it addresses its internal challenges.

---

### üá®üá≥ **China: Rising Power, But Facing Major Tests**

* China is in the **rising stage of the empire cycle**, with:

  * Strong **economic momentum** and a long-term strategic vision.
  * Rapidly increasing **technological capabilities**.
  * Greater control by a **centralized government**, allowing for long-term planning.

* **Risks and constraints:**

  * High **debt levels**, especially in real estate and local governments.
  * **Authoritarian governance**, which may limit innovation and create social friction.
  * Growing **geopolitical resistance**, especially from the U.S. and allies.
  * A **shrinking population** and demographic decline.

* **Outlook:** China has the **potential to overtake the U.S. economically**, but it is **not guaranteed**‚Äîsuccess depends on **managing its internal weaknesses and global tensions**.

---

### üåê Dalio‚Äôs Big Picture:

* He sees a **transition in world order**‚Äîthe U.S.-led order is weakening, and a **multipolar world** is emerging.
* A shift from **Western dominance to Eastern influence**, with **China as the central challenger**.
* The outcome depends heavily on how both nations manage **debt, conflict, innovation, and leadership**.



## some deep questions on current economic env
1. Is US still the best investment environment?
2. Where should we investor park our investment?
- even if dollarization happend
- jeffery sach think that it would be a multi-polar and multi curreny world, and US will no longer be a dominant economy, same for its currency
- even If US loses its position just like UK decades ago,UK today is still a thriving financial market.
- However, investment env depends on the trust of the business world, with US having a high accounting and finance transparency
- In China, finance and accounting transparency and regulation is still not there yet
- Compared to this, Singapore seems to be a good investment env. However, Singapore stock market lacks liquidity and growth. Maybe for dividend gain, but hardly any capital gain


## can USA continue to print money non-stop?
The U.S. *can always print more money* (through the Federal Reserve) to *repay debt* because:

* The debt is *denominated in U.S. dollars*, which the U.S. controls.
* It cannot go bankrupt in the same way a household or foreign-currency borrower can.
* This is known as *monetary sovereignty*.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è *But There Are Consequences:*

#### 1. *Inflation Risk*

* Printing large amounts of money can *devalue the currency, leading to **inflation*.
* If done excessively, it could lead to *hyperinflation* (like in Zimbabwe or Venezuela).

#### 2. *Loss of Investor Confidence*

* If investors believe the U.S. is inflating its debt away, they may:

  * Demand *higher interest rates*
  * *Sell U.S. bonds*
  * Move to *other currencies or assets*

#### 3. *Currency Devaluation*

* Excess printing can weaken the U.S. dollar globally, raising the cost of imports and potentially hurting global trust in the dollar as the world's reserve currency.

---

### üßæ Real-World Strategy:

Rather than printing to repay, the U.S. usually:

* *Borrows more to roll over old debt*
* *Manages debt via growth: If the economy grows faster than the debt, the **debt-to-GDP ratio falls over time*

---

### üìå Bottom Line:

* *Can* the U.S. print money to repay debt? *Yes.*
* *Should* it? *Only very carefully‚Äîbecause the **real limit isn‚Äôt technical, it‚Äôs inflation and credibility.*

## Can USA have both trade surplus and with USD as the dominant currency?

his touches on a deep and widely discussed economic principle known as the *Triffin Dilemma*.

---

### üí∞ The Core Problem:

The U.S. *cannot easily have both*:

1. A *dominant global reserve currency* (the U.S. dollar), and
2. A consistent *trade surplus*

‚Äîbecause the role of the *global reserve currency* inherently *requires the U.S. to run trade deficits*.

---

### üåç Why? (The Triffin Dilemma explained simply)

To keep the *U.S. dollar in global circulation* (so other countries can use it for trade and reserves), the U.S. must:

* Export *more dollars than it imports in goods*
* Which means: *running trade deficits*

If the U.S. tried to *run a trade surplus*:

* It would be *exporting more goods, but **importing fewer goods* and thus *exporting fewer dollars*
* This would *reduce the global dollar supply*, choking the very demand for the dollar that sustains its reserve currency status

### üßæ Summary: Why They Clash

| Feature                 | Dominant Dollar Role                     | Trade Surplus Goal                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Requires...             | Exporting capital/dollars                | Exporting goods and importing capital |
| U.S. must...            | Run trade deficits (import more)         | Run trade surpluses (export more)     |
| Effect on global dollar | Increases supply (other nations hold \$) | Reduces supply (fewer dollars abroad) |

---

### üìâ The Result:

* The U.S. *cannot easily balance both* roles without undermining one.
* A *strong dollar* (due to reserve demand) makes *U.S. exports less competitive, reinforcing the **trade deficit*.

---

### üß† Bottom Line:

You can't *both flood the world with dollars* (needed for reserve currency dominance) and *hoard dollars* by selling more than you buy (which a trade surplus requires).
